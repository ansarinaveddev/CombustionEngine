                <p><span class="point">1. Intake:</span> Also known as induction or suction. This stroke of the piston
                    begins at top dead center (T.D.C.) and ends at bottom dead center (B.D.C.). In this stroke the
                    intake valve must be in the open position while the piston pulls an air-fuel mixture into the
                    cylinder by producing a partial vacuum (negative pressure) in the cylinder through its downward
                    motion.</p>

            <div class="boxes">
                <p><span class="point">2. Compression: </span> This stroke begins at B.D.C, or just at the end of the
                    suction stroke, and ends at T.D.C. In this stroke the piston compresses the air-fuel mixture in
                    preparation for ignition during the power stroke (below). Both the intake and exhaust valves are
                    closed during this stage</p>

            <div class="boxes">
                <p> <span class="point">3. Combustion:</span> Also known as power or ignition. This is the start of the
                    second revolution of the four stroke cycle. At this point the crankshaft has completed a full 360
                    degree revolution. While the piston is at T.D.C. (the end of the compression stroke) the compressed
                    air-fuel mixture is ignited by a spark plug (in a gasoline engine) or by heat generated by high
                    compression (diesel engines), forcefully returning the piston to B.D.C. This stroke produces
                    mechanical work from the engine to turn the crankshaft.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="boxes">
                <p><span class="point">4. Exhaust:</span> Also known as outlet. During the exhaust stroke, the piston, once
                    again, returns from B.D.C. to T.D.C. while the exhaust valve is open. This action expels the spent
                    air-fuel mixture through the exhaust port.</p>
